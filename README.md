This is a test example of a chat app build with Socket.IO. To start the app:

1. Run "npm start" in the server folder.
2. Then "npm run dev" in the client folder.
3. Open the app in two separate windows, join a room with the same ID and start messaging.

There are also logs in the server terminal. Enjoy!
